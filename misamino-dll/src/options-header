# The default max_nodes under bot options is the largest valid value.
# However, you should probably limit this value to something appropriate
# for your setup, as otherwise Cold Clear will keep thinking unboundedly
# even after the game has ended, consuming more and more memory.
# Valid movement modes are ZeroG (default), TwentyG, and HardDropOnly.
# Valid pathfinder modes are Das (default), and Hypertap.
# The `sub_name` field is completely ignored as it cannot be displayed.
# This version of Cold Clear uses `fast_config`, which is optimised for
# high-speed games. As such, it will not stack as high and skim more.
# Cold Clear vs Cold Clear is untested. This binary is prone to crashes.
