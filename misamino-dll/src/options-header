# The default max_nodes under bot options is the largest valid value.
# However, you should probably limit this value to something appropriate
# for your setup, as otherwise Cold Clear will keep thinking unboundedly
# even after the game has ended.
# Valid movement modes are ZeroG (default), TwentyG, and HardDropOnly.
# Note that this information is ignored when using custom pathfinders.
# For info on writing a custom pathfinder, view the example pathfinder
# in the repository's `das-pathfinder-dll` crate.
# The `sub_name` field is completely ignored as it cannot be displayed.
# This version of Cold Clear uses `fast_config`, which is optimised for
# high-speed games. As such, it will not stack as high and skim more.
# This version of Cold Clear also misdrops far more, which is why it is
# advised to use `das_pf.dll` to reduce misdrops. Note that Cold Clear
# still misdrops frequently even with the DAS pathfinder.
# Cold Clear vs Cold Clear is untested. This binary is prone to crashes.
